# __Example: *hal_adc_calibration*__

**Example version:** 2.0.0

[![User Manual](doc/read_the-UM.svg)](https://dev.st.com/stm32cube-docs/examples/arch-v1/en/index.html "An offline version is also available in the STM32Cube firmware package.")

How to use the ADC to perform self-calibration, retrieve calibration factors and reinject them at a later stage.
Ability to do so can be useful in low-power application: in a low-power mode removing power supply of ADC, calibration factors are reset, then restored quickly at wakeup, instead of spending time performing a self-calibration.

This example is based on the ADC HAL API.


## __1. Detailed scenario__

__Initialization phase__: At main program start, the `mx_system_init()` function is called. It initializes the peripherals, nonvolatile memory (such as flash memory, NVM, or external memories), MPU regions (if applicable), the system clock, and the SysTick.

The application executes the following __example steps__:

__Step 1__: The ADC is initialized.

__Step 2__: The ADC is activated.

__Step 3__: The ADC autocalibration is performed to ensure accurate measurements. The calibration is a prerequisite
to any ADC operation. It removes the systematic errors that may vary from chip to chip.

__Step 4__: Retrieves the ADC calibration factors to reinject them in the next loop.

__Step 5__: Resets the ADC calibration factors to emulate low-power mode.

__Step 6__: Reinjects copy of the ADC calibration factors from the previous loop.

__End of example__: The ADC calibration is generated indefinitely.
The example status is reported via the variable **`ExecStatus`**, and the status LED
remains turned on in case of success.

If you enable `USE_TRACE`, you can follow these execution steps in the terminal logs:

```test
[INFO] Step 1: ADC initialization COMPLETED.
[INFO] Step 2: ADC start COMPLETED.
[INFO] Step 3: ADC calibration COMPLETED.
[INFO] Step 4: ADC get calibration factor COMPLETED.
[INFO] Step 5: ADC emulate calibration factor loss by loading a dummy calibration COMPLETED.
[INFO] Step 6: ADC set calibration factor COMPLETED.

```


## __2. Example configuration__

[![Configuration Manual](doc/configure_with-ConfigurationMa.svg)](https://dev.st.com/stm32cube-docs/examples/arch-v1/en/configure/config_toc.html "An offline version is also available in the STM32Cube firmware package.")

__ADC__: is configured with the following parameters:

- Single channel conversion.
- Continuous conversion mode.
- Software trigger.


## __3. Hardware environment and setup__

### __3.1. Generic Setup__

JTAG/SWD probe may be used to check variables.

### __3.2. Specific board setups__

This section describes the exact hardware configurations of your project.
This example can run without external setup: in this case, ADC measures a floating voltage level and
conversion data are not deterministic.
To control voltage converted by ADC, apply a voltage level in range [0; VDDA] on pin ADCx_INy mentioned in table below.

## __4. Troubleshooting__

[![Troubleshooting](doc/debug_with-Troubleshooting.svg)](https://dev.st.com/stm32cube-docs/examples/arch-v1/en/debug/debug_toc.html "An offline version is also available in the STM32Cube firmware package.")

Here are the points of attention for this specific example:

__Warning__: When debugging the ADC, any read to Data Register (DR) clears the End of Conversion flag (EOC).\
For instance, debugging step by step with any register inspection view, might break the HAL/example behavior.
