# __Example: *hal_rcc_lsi_config*__

**Example version:** 2.0.0

[![User Manual](doc/read_the-UM.svg)](https://dev.st.com/stm32cube-docs/examples/arch-v1/en/index.html "An offline version is also available in the STM32Cube firmware package.")

How to configure the LSI (Low Speed Internal) clock and enable/disable it using the RCC HAL APIs.


## __1. Detailed scenario__

__Initialization phase__: At main program start, the `mx_system_init()` function is called. It initializes the peripherals, nonvolatile memory (such as flash memory, NVM, or external memories), MPU regions (if applicable), the system clock, and the SysTick.

The application executes the following __example steps__:

__Step 1__: The MCO (Microcontroller Clock Output) is configured to output the LSI. The RTC domain
access is granted if necessary to be able to change the LSI state.

__Step 2__: The LSI is disabled during LSI_DISABLE_DELAY_MS ms and then re-enabled.

__Step 3__: The LSI status has been restored to be outputted to the MCO pin.

__End of example__: After step 3, the example terminates. You can check the status LED.

If you enable `USE_TRACE`, you can follow these steps in the terminal logs:
(Here is an example with the NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q, the default LSI frequency may differ for another board)

```text
[INFO] Step 1: MCO pin initialized to output the LSI clock.
[INFO] Step 2: LSI enabled (32000 Hz) to MCO pin, with a x divider (MCO freq: xxxx Hz).
[INFO] Step 2: LSI disabled.
[INFO] Step 3: LSI status restored and outputted on MCO pin.
```

The divider depends on the configuration of the series and so the MCO frequency too.


## __2. Example configuration__

This example demonstrates the following peripheral:

__RCC__:

The example uses the RCC to enable and disable the LSI clock.


## __3. Hardware environment and setup__

### __3.1. Generic Setup__

No specific hardware setup is needed for this example.
Nevertheless, an oscilloscope may also be used to monitor the system clock value on the MCO pin.

## __4. Troubleshooting__

Here are the points of attention for this specific example:

__LSI state__: For some series, LSI is part of the RTC domain and access to it must be granted to modify the LSI state.
