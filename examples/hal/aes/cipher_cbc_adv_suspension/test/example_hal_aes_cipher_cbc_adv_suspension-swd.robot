*** Test Cases ***
${TEST_ID} Scenario adherence
    [Documentation]    This test checks that the application binary runs according to
    ...    the scenario described in the README.
    Example Step 1
    Example Step 2
    Example Step 3


*** Keywords ***
Example Step 1
    [Documentation]    Initializes, configures the AES and the timer peripherals.
    ...    Checks that initialization (app_init) runs without error
    Comment    Check initialization (app_init) runs without error

    Comment    ExecStatus value is then EXEC_STATUS_INIT_OK
    ...    but becomes immediately EXEC_STATUS_OK as there is no delay after.

Example Step 2
    [Documentation]    Demonstrates how to suspend the AES CBC encryption IT process,
    ...    using the timer to request suspend encryption, called in HAL_TIM_UpdateCallback,
    ...    by setting the Suspendflag. Followed by decryption process in IT mode,
    ...    then Resumes the IT encryption process.
    Comment    Check application (app_process) runs without error

    Comment    Nothing to do here

Example Step 3
    [Documentation]    Deinitializes the AES and the timer peripherals before leaving the scenario.
    ...    Checks that uninitialization (app_deinit) runs without error
    ...    Assuming the test scenario lasts under 5s
    Check Integer Variable    ExecStatus    ${EXEC_STATUS_OK}    timeout=5s
