# __Example: *hal_cordic_sincos_it*__

**Example version:** 2.0.0

[![User Manual](doc/read_the-UM.svg)](https://dev.st.com/stm32cube-docs/examples/arch-v1/en/index.html "An offline version is also available in the Cube Firmware package.")

How to calculate sines and cosines array in IT mode, using the CORDIC HAL API.


## __1. Detailed scenario__

In this example, the CPU and an IT share buffers to manage the data: `Q1_31` and `CalculatedSinCos`.

__Initialization phase__: At main program start, the `mx_system_init()` function is called. It initializes the peripherals, nonvolatile memory (such as flash memory, NVM, or external memories), MPU regions (if applicable), the system clock, and the SysTick.

The application executes the following __example steps__:

__Step 1__: The applicative code initializes the CORDIC instance.

__Step 2__: Prepares the input values for CORDIC: angles must be in radians divided by pi and presented in Q1.31 format.

__Step 3__: Starts CORDIC calculation in IT mode.

__Step 4__: Waits for the CORDIC read IT transfer completion.
            Then compares the CORDIC results to the reference values.

__Step 5__: Deinitializes the CORDIC instance before leaving the scenario.

__End of example__: reports the outcome of the data transfer via the variable **`ExecStatus`** and the **status LED** remains turned on in case of success.


## __2. Example configuration__

__CORDIC__: is configured with the following parameters:

- function: Sine. It includes sine as primary result and cosine as secondary result.
- argument: 1. The angle is expressed in radians divided by pi.
- results: 2. Sine and cosine.
- input and output size: 32b. Thus, format Q1.31 is used.
- precision: 6. Best precision for sines and cosines.
- Scale:0. Mandatory for sine and cosine functions.
