# __Example: *ll_i3c_ibi_controller*__

**Example version:** 2.0.0

[![User Manual](doc/read_the-UM.svg)](https://dev.st.com/stm32cube-docs/examples/arch-v1/en/index.html "An offline version is also available in the STM32Cube firmware package.")


How to handle In-Band Interrupts (IBI) from multiple targets using the I3C bus protocol and STM32 LL Layer in interrupt-driven (IT) mode.

**Note that the terminology Controller/Target characterizes the role taken by each device in the I3C communication, corresponding respectively to the I3C master and I3C slave in legacy terminology.**


## __1. Detailed scenario__

This example demonstrates controller-side In-Band Interrupt (IBI) handling for multiple already dynamically addressed targets using the I3C protocol and LL Layer in interrupt-driven (IT) mode. By default, the scenario is set up for two targets connected to the controller.

__Initialization phase__: At main program start, the `mx_system_init()` function is called. It initializes the peripherals, nonvolatile memory (such as flash memory, NVM, or external memories), MPU regions (if applicable), the system clock, and the SysTick.

The application executes the following __example steps__:

__Step 1__: Initialization of the I3C instance.

__Step 2__: Starts the DAA/ENTDAA procedure by sending ENTDAA, receives each target's BCR/DCR/PID payload, assigns a dynamic address sequentially, and repeats until all responding targets are processed or no further responses occur.

__Step 3__: Enables IBI notification and waits for either IBI completion or transfer error.

__Step 4__: Verifies the received IBI: payload length and payload value to ensure correct processing.

The communication status is reported via the status LED and the variable ExecStatus.

__End of example__: When DAA completes successfully and at least one IBI is received and verified, the scenario is considered complete. If the maximum number of attempts is reached, an error status is reported.


## __2. Example configuration__

[![Configuration Manual](doc/configure_with-ConfigurationMa.svg)](https://dev.st.com/stm32cube-docs/examples/arch-v1/en/configure/config_toc.html "An offline version is also available in the STM32Cube firmware package.")

This example demonstrates the following peripherals.


__I3C__: is configured as indicated below:

- The controller assigns dynamic addresses (default: 0x32 and 0x34) to two targets during ENTDAA. These addresses are set in the `TargetsDescriptor ` array in the example. You can modify these values or add more addresses by updating the entries in the `TargetsDescriptor ` array to support additional targets as needed.

- The bus usage, including the I3C bus and its duty cycle timings, is calculated by STM32CubeMX2 in accordance with the I3C initialization section of the reference manual.

- The I3C bus is configured to run at the maximum supported speed to demonstrate its highest performance.
  See `__I3C maximum speed__` in section [3.2 Specific board setups](#32-specific-board-setups).
- The event and error interrupts of the I3C instance are configured and enabled in the NVIC.

To test this example with the target, you can use the corresponding *ll_i3c_ibi_target* example pack.


## __3. Hardware environment and setup__

### __3.1. Generic Setup__

- The controller board is connected to the target board through the two I3C lines and a common GND.

## __4. Troubleshooting__

[![Troubleshooting](doc/debug_with-Troubleshooting.svg)](https://dev.st.com/stm32cube-docs/examples/arch-v1/en/debug/debug_toc.html "An offline version is also available in the STM32Cube firmware package.")

Here are the points of attention for this specific example:

  1. __Dynamic Address Assignment (DAA)__: DAA is started by the controller using the `ENTDAA` command, one of the I3C Common Command Codes (CCC), standard broadcast commands used to manage devices on the bus. The controller enumerates each target, which responds with its identification payload (PID, BCR, DCR). The controller then assigns a unique dynamic address to each target, which is used for all further private transfers.
  In this example, DAA completion and address verification are handled via interrupts (see Step 2).

  2. __In-Band Interrupt (IBI)__: IBI is an I3C feature that allows a target to asynchronously request service from the controller over the I3C bus (no dedicated GPIO interrupt line). The controller can accept (ACK) or reject (NACK) the request. Depending on the target capability, an IBI can be sent with or without a short payload.
  If no IBI is observed, verify that the controller is configured to accept the target IBI request and that the target triggers an IBI after it has a valid dynamic address.

  3. If there are no I3C signals observed, remember to check these points first:
     - The GND pins of the controller and target boards are connected.
     - Use the shortest possible wires between the boards to improve signal integrity.

  4. For correct synchronization, always run the target application before running the controller. This ensures the target is ready to respond to the controller's DAA request.

__Error handling__: In LL examples, error handling is controlled by the USE_LL_APP_ERROR constant in the application files to reduce code footprint. This compilation flag is disabled by default. If the example does not behave as expected, enable error handling for debugging by setting USE_LL_APP_ERROR to 1 in ll_example.h.
