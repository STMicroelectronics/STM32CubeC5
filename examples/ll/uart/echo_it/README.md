# __Example: *ll_uart_echo_it*__

**Example version:** 2.0.0

How to implement UART communication in it mode, driven by serial a terminal emulator, using the LL API.


## __1. Detailed scenario__

This example demonstrates the UART transmission (transmit/receive) in it mode between a board and a serial terminal emulator PC application.

The LL UART transmission and reception APIs are used in interrupt mode to implement a half-duplex echo mechanism with a terminal emulator. To ensure that user input and echoed output do not overlap and become mixed in the serial console, data reception is temporarily paused while the MCU transmits the echoed data back to the terminal.

__Initialization phase__: At main program start, the `mx_system_init()` function is called. It initializes the peripherals, nonvolatile memory (such as flash memory, NVM, or external memories), MPU regions (if applicable), the system clock, and the SysTick.

The application executes the following __example steps__:

__Step 1__: Configures and initializes the UART instance.

__Step 2__: Transmits a start message in interrupt mode to invite the user to enter data via the terminal.

__Step 3__: Waits for one of these UART interrupts: write transfer complete or transfer error.

__Step 4__:  The UART_ReceiveUntilCM_IT API is used for UART reception, as it allows the MCU to stop data receiving immediately when the user presses Enter, enabling immediate processing and echoing of complete user commands.

__Step 5__: Waits for one of these UART interrupts: read transfer complete or transfer error.

__Step 6__: Transmits the received buffer back to the user.

__Step 7__: Waits for one of these UART interrupts: write transfer complete or transfer error.

__End of example__: As long as no error occurs, the characters received are sent back to the user through the terminal emulator.


## __2. Example configuration__

The example demonstrates the following peripheral:

__UART__:

The UART is configured with the following settings:

- The baud rate is set to 115200.
- The word length is set to 8 bits.
- Stop bits are set to 1 bit.
- Parity is set to NONE.

### __3.1. Generic Setup__

This section describes the hardware setup principles that apply to any board.

## __4. Troubleshooting__

[![Troubleshooting](doc/debug_with-Troubleshooting.svg)](https://dev.st.com/stm32cube-docs/examples/arch-v1/en/debug/debug_toc.html "An offline version is also available in the STM32Cube firmware package.")

Find below the points of attention for this specific example.

__Host PC settings__: Configure your terminal emulator with the following settings:

1. Set the UART parameters to match the required configuration.

2. Ensure the stop bits are correctly set, considering whether they are included in the data length.

3. Local echo is enabled, so that you can see the characters you type.

4. New-line mode is set to {}LF{} (Line Feed) so that the application can detect the end of line correctly.

__Error handling__: In LL examples, error handling is controlled by the USE_LL_APP_ERROR constant in the application files to reduce code footprint. This compilation flag is disabled by default. If the example does not behave as expected, enable error handling for debugging by setting USE_LL_APP_ERROR to 1 in ll_example.h.
