*** Test Cases ***
${TEST_ID} Scenario adherence
    [Documentation]    This test checks that the application binary runs according to
    ...    the scenario described in the README.
    Example Step 1
    Example Step 2
    Example Step 3


*** Keywords ***
Example Step 1
    [Documentation]    Initialization phase: Initialization of: Basic stdio,
    ...    instruction cache (2-ways set associative cache) and STM32 Cryptographic library.
    ...    Checks that initialization (app_init) runs without error
    Comment    Check initialization (app_init) runs without error

    Comment    ExecStatus value is then EXEC_STATUS_INIT_OK
    ...    but becomes immediately EXEC_STATUS_OK as there is no delay after.

Example Step 2
    [Documentation]    Demonstrates how to use the STM32 Cryptographic library to digest a message
    ...    using the SHA3-SHAKE compliant algorithm in two ways:
    ...    2.1: Computes the digest using single API call method:
    ...    Algorithm configuration and execution is done via a single API call.
    ...    2.2: Computes the digest using multiple API calls method:
    ...    Algorithm configuration and execution is done in several API calls,
    ...    allowing in particular a piecemeal injection of data to process.
    Comment    Nothing to check

Example Step 3
    [Documentation]    Deinitializes STM32 Cryptographic library before leaving the scenario.
    ...    Checks that uninitialization (app_deinit) runs without error
    ...    Assuming the test scenario lasts under 5s
    Check Integer Variable    ExecStatus    ${EXEC_STATUS_OK}    timeout=5s
